#' Data Type - per_disability
#' 
#' verifies wether the object has the expected format and fullfills some boundary conditions. This is just a dummy that makes my life easier, as with it I can more easily query for the codes for all data types in the Graph Validation.
#' 
#' @param per_disability put in the object you want to check.
#' @return none the code will just throw an error if the object is not as expected.  
#' @export 
#'
